Data Science MSc Thesis on Airline Fleet Planning: Optimising Airline Fleet Planning: A Universal Model Using Advanced Analytics

Abstract:
This research presents an adaptive model for airline fleet planning, leveraging advanced analytics and domain knowledge. The study addresses the challenge of determining optimal fleet size and composition, considering factors such as acquisition, retrofitting, seating configuration, and route profitability. The research employs a manual compilation of Low-Cost Carriers (LCCs) and Cargo carriers operating in the United States from 1990 to 2023, revealing distinct market demand patterns for LCCs and Full-Service Carriers (FSCs). The study utilizes the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and R-squared for model evaluation, highlighting the effectiveness of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with exogenous variables (ARIMAX) in different market segments. The research also integrates fleet planning models with the Hub and Spoke (HS) network, introducing managerial decision-making options that impact operational costs and extend aircraft lifespan. The study concludes by emphasizing the need for individual route forecasting and proposes avenues for future research, particularly in demand segmentation by class. The research contributes valuable insights into forecasting methodologies and decision variables shaping optimal fleet composition, paving the way for continued advancements in aviation research.
